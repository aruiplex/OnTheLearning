# Numpy

Numpy is a most famous Python lib. Write by C++. Many of these computed lib is written by C++.





## ndarray

The most interesting thing in Numpy is the `ndarray`. The most elegant array I have been found.



It overload the operator `*`, therefore it can be written as 

```python
x = np.asndarray([0.0, 59.0, 135.0, 200.0, 220.0, 308.0, 490.0])
y = coeff*x + bias
```



The append operation in the `ndarray` is:



```python
arr = np.append(arr, item)

```
