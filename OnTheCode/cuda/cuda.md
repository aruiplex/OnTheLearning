# Cuda

## What

## What is GPU?

More memory bandwidth and more higher instruction throughmap.

While the CPU is designed to excel at executing a sequence of operations, called a thread, as fast as possible and can execute a few tens of these threads in parallel, the GPU is designed to excel at executing thousands of them in parallel (amortizing the slower single-thread performance to achieve greater throughput).

GPU use less memory cache and more computation to hide memory access latencies.

## What is cuda?

It is used to control GPU to perform compute operation. It is a parallel computing platform. Support many languages.
