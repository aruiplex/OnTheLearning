# Make

Make is also *makefile*, which is the build system to build c or cpp program.

Make drives the compiler and other build tools to build (compile) code.

This means Make **directly** drive the compiler.



And Cmake is the generator of buildsystems. It can create makefiles, which means it is not directly drive the compiler. And it also generate other format makefiles.
