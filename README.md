# OnTheLearning

This my recording and thinking on the learning.

I divided it into 6 parts:

1. OnTheApp: the using record about interesting and helpful apps.
2. OnTheCode: PL(programming languages) i have been used.
3. OnTheFirmware: hardware i have been used.
4. OnThePattern: design and code patterns.
5. OnTheSystem: Linux, Windows (ABSOLUTELY NO MAC)
6. OnTheAlgo: Fumble on the algorithmic road.
   1. @AlgoImpl: implementations of algo, include of Golang and Java.

This should be different from Major or subject. It should more coupling.
